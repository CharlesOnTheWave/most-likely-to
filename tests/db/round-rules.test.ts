// Round rules (#3) through the roles' own doors: RPC with the publishable key, as guests and as signed-in hosts, past
// the Worker. Oracle: PRD FR-008 (one person or an abstention, the voter included), FR-009 (the reveal after the last
// vote or when the host moves on, at any time), US-01 (at least 2 guests plus the voting host) and the decisions of
// context/archive/2026-10-13-first-live-round/research.md (D2: a vote is final; D3: no threshold for the reveal).
// Every expected count is written out by hand from the scenario, never computed.
//
// S-03 adds the evening's moves (next_round, skip_round, end_game): only the room's own leader makes them (PRD Access
// Control; the host, and since S-07 a co-host too), checked here; the evening's own rules are
// tests/db/game-rules.test.ts's. The same for S-08's "Wpuść" and "Odrzuć" (admit_latecomer, reject_latecomer, from
// *_latecomer_admission.sql), whose own rules are
// tests/db/latecomers.test.ts's, and for S-06's moves on the game's question list (open_question_list,
// draw_list_question, remove_list_question, edit_list_question, add_own_question, from *_question_list_review.sql),
// whose own rules are tests/db/question-list.test.ts's.
//
// A refusal is the function's answer { ok: false, reason }, never "some error". S-07 (*_co_host_role.sql) grants the
// leader's moves to anon, so a co-host can make them with its token: someone with no token gets room_unknown and a
// guest of the room without the role not_leader; giving the role (set_cohost) stays host A's own. The co-host's own
// rules are tests/db/cohost.test.ts's.
//
// The round functions come from supabase/migrations/*_first_live_round.sql, the evening's from
// *_full_game_evening.sql. Without them PostgREST answers each such call with PGRST202 (no such function): a suite that
// starts a round in beforeAll is red as a whole, and every other test here is red on its own probe.
//

// closes the one before); Vitest runs the suites in order, each suite's beforeAll right before its tests.
