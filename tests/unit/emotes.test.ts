// S-16 (PRD FR-023): a player sends one of six emotes to the whole room, and everyone sees it with the sender's nick.
// The oracle is Karol's decision of 2026-10-26 (context/changes/room-emotes/change.md, Notes): ❤️ 👍 👎 😭 🤬 💀 in
// this order, with the nick. The channel is public, so a screen shows an emote only when its id is one of the six and
// its nick is a player's on the screen's own list, as it stands there: case counts, as it does in a nick
// (context/domain/glossary.md, "nick"). Every expected value is written out by hand; nothing here is read from EMOTES.

// The ids as the plan names them (context/changes/room-emotes/plan.md, Faza 1 #1), in Karol's order.
const IDS = ["heart", "like", "dislike", "cry", "angry", "skull"];

// The room's players on the receiving screen, a nick with an emoji among them.
