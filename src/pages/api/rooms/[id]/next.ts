// "Następne pytanie", for the room's leader: the host by the session, a co-host by the room's cookie (S-07), once the
// round on the leader's screen is revealed or skipped. The body carries that round's number ({round}), so a double
// click or a resent request never moves past a question nobody has seen (round_over). The Worker sends the game's
// whole pool in random order (src/lib/rounds/draw.ts), from the room's categories that room_lobby gives a leader only
// (leader_draw), and next_round opens the first question not played in this game yet (FR-015; decision D1 of
// context/archive/2026-10-15-full-game-evening/research.md). When none is left, next_round answers no_questions, the
// start's code, whose text tells the host to set up a new game; that would close the game in play. So this route
// answers questions_ran_out instead, whose text says the game can be ended (F5 of the S-03 review). JSON from the room
// screen: {ok: true} or {error: code} (src/lib/rooms/json-route.ts).
